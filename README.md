# JavaScript_Draw_Animation
JavaScript examples to demonstrate the process of creating simple Animations using JS Animation Frames.

The following scripts are written to demonstrate the process of drawing Animations using JavaScript and CSS.
JavaScript animations are best implemented via requestAnimationFrame. Request Animation Frame is a built-in JavaScript method that allows one to setup a callback function to run when the browser will be preparing a repaint.
Examples used in the scripts include generating HTML bouncing ball gravity, and creating a Ball Projectile.
